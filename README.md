# JoinsWithCountry
Adds country to join messages (based on IP address)\
It won't lookup the country when a player joins while there are no players on the server

This mod uses http://www.geoplugin.net/json.gp for geolocation

This mod was inspired by the [Jump Academy](https://github.com/Jump-Academy) Team Fortress 2 servers that have this feature

## Commands
`/countryjoins` (OP-only)\
Shows lookup stats like amount of cache hits, web requests (IP wasn't found in cache), and amount of IPs currently cached
